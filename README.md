# databot_OpenAI_API

This project demonstrates the capabilities of the OpenAI API by building a Data-Driven Question Answering (Q&A) system. Given a data file as input, the system utilizes ChatGPT to effectively answer questions related to the content within the data file. This project demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to extract meaningful insights from data and provide human-like responses.
